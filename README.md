## PID & PPID

Understanding the basics of the process and its unique identifiers is crucial. In this section, we provide an introduction to retrieving process IDs and their parents.

## Arguments

Working with command line arguments is a fundamental aspect of shell programming. In this section, we demonstrate how to handle command line arguments effectively.

## Executing a program

Executing programs within a shell is an essential task. In this section, we provide insights into the `execve` system call and its usage.

## Creating processes

Creating processes is a core concept in system programming. In this section, we illustrate how to create child processes using the `fork` system call.

## Wait

The `wait` system call is essential for managing processes. In this section, we provide an overview of how to use `wait` to ensure proper execution flow.

## File information

Accessing file information using the `stat` system call is crucial for various operations. In this section, we cover how to retrieve file status information.

## Environment

Understanding and manipulating the environment in a process is an essential skill. In this section, we provide practical examples and exercises related to managing the environment.

## Exercises

This section contains exercises related to each concept covered in the README. It serves as a hands-on guide to reinforce your understanding of shell coding and system programming.

## Installation

To run these examples and exercises, ensure that you have a compatible C compiler installed on your system.

## Usage

Each example and exercise comes with its own compilation and execution instructions. Refer to individual sections for specific usage guidelines.
